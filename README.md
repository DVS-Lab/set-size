# set-size
How do set size, set composition, and choice target affect the decisions that individuals make? Participants will be presented with various snack items and cash amounts and asked to rate them on various scales for themselves and another person.

This study consists of two tasks:
  1) Participants rate photos of popular snack items individually based on how they enjoy the snack overall and by how familiar they are with the snack.
  2) Participants make a series of choices involving money and snack items. Ex. A participant is given the opportunity to choose whether they want $0.50 or a choice amongst a set of items. Participants will also be asked to make decisions for another person.
  
At the end of the experiment, one of the choices will be selected randomly and the participant will be given the item they chose on that specific trial (e.g. money or a specific snack item).

## Instructions for running tasks after downloading repository
  1) Unzip images folder and place into task a
  2) If running task B using task A data from 2018, rename set-size folder to JOCN-master
  3) Follow protocol listed here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AA06SXLgHKVxUk9PVA (request access through Victoria)

## Instructions for analyzing task B data (Hypothesis 1)
  1) Note: this is a Matlab script.
  2) Make sure everything is located in the correct directory (within this repository).
    Note: we currently store data outside of GitHub.
  3) List sub ID's in the correct order within the code.
  4) Run script in Matlab.
